This was the very first Project in my 16-week Bootcamp-Course.
The task was to build a Website for a Food Blog.
Graded was the way we used propper semantic elements and correct identions for HTMLas well as
that we used CSS selectors to style the page. The classes were to have useful names.
The contact-us link in the footer had to link to https://codefactory.wien/en/contact-en/.
We were to use Flexbox and/or Grid to display the cards according to the design given.
Also the position-attributes to place the pictures and overlays were important.
For this Exam it was also very important to use media-query to male the project nice to look at
for Laptop, Tablet and Mobile-Phone.
A "recipe of the Month"-page was also to be added and filled with individula content.
The last page to add was the About link in the footer to make with an individual design/layout.
This page was to have a navbar, a middle section with the main content about the Food Blog and a footer.
Bootstrap was not allowed to be used for this exam.

I recieved 40 of max 40 Points for this Exam.
